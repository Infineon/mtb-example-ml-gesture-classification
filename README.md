## Hardware setup

Connect the CY8CKIT-028-TFT shield to the baseboard header compatible with Arduino.

The code example also works with the CY8CKIT-028-SENSE shield. See the [Operation](#operation) section for more information.


## Software setup

Install a terminal emulator if you don't have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://teratermproject.github.io/index-en.html).

Install the Machine Learning pack using this [link](https://softwaretools.infineon.com/tools/com.ifx.tb.tool.modustoolboxpackmachinelearning).

Install the Python interpreter and add it to the top of the system path in environmental variables. This code example is tested with [Python v3.8.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3810/).

Use the ModusToolbox&trade;-ML Configurator tool (from *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/packs/ModusToolbox-Machine-Learning-Pack/tools/ml-configurator/*) to load a pre-trained NN model and generate C files to be used with this code example. Alternatively, you can launch the configurator tool in Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; from the Quick Launch window. For more information, see the [ModusToolbox&trade; Machine Learning user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxMLUserGuide).

By default, the Makefile uses a model that comes with the code example. The pre-trained neural net (NN) model is located in the *pretrained_models* folder. The output files location is set to **mtb_ml_gen**; the project name is set to *magic_wand*. You can use the ModusToolbox&trade;-ML Configurator tool to open the *design.mtbml* model to evaluate the model.

By default, the output files location is set to *mtb_ml_gen*. The project name is set to *MAGIC_WAND*. If you change any of these default settings, edit the following Makefile parameters of this code example:

Makefile parameter    | Description
 ---------------------| ---------------
`NN_TYPE=`            | Defines the input data format and NN weights. It can be `float`, `int16x16`, `int16x8`, or `int8x8`.
`NN_MODEL_NAME=`      | Defines the name of the model. The name comes from the *project name* defined in the ML Configurator tool. No quotes are used when changing the name of the model.
`NN_MODEL_FOLDER=`    | Sets the name where the model files will be placed. The name comes from the *output file location* defined in the ModusToolbox&trade;-ML Configurator tool.
`NN_INFERENCE_ENGINE` | Defines the inference engine to run. It has three options: `tflm`, `tflm_less`, and `ifx`

For information on available inference engines, see the [ModusToolbox&trade; Machine Learning user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxMLUserGuide).

> **Note**: The `tflm` and `tflm_less` inference engines only support `float` and `int8x8`.

## Operation

If using a PSoC&trade; 64 "Secure" MCU kit (like CY8CKIT-064B0S2-4343W), the PSoC&trade; 64 device must be provisioned with keys and policies before being programmed. Follow the instructions in the ["Secure Boot" SDK user guide](https://www.infineon.com/dgdlac/Infineon-PSoC_64_Secure_MCU_Secure_Boot_SDK_User_Guide-Software-v07_00-EN.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8c7d0d8da4017d0f8c361a7666) to provision the device. If the kit is already provisioned, copy-paste the keys and policy folder to the application folder.

1. Connect the CY8CKIT-028-TFT shield to the baseboard.

   If using the CY8CKIT-028-SENSE shield, change `SHIELD_DATA_COLLECTION=CY_028_TFT_SHIELD` in the Makefile based on the shields revision.

   To check the version of CY8CKIT-028-SENSE, locate the sticker on the bottom of the shield's box which indicates the revision.

   - If the shield is Rev "**", use `SHIELD_DATA_COLLECTION=CY_028_SENSE_SHIELD_v1`.
   - If the shield is Rev "*B", use `SHIELD_DATA_COLLECTION=CY_028_SENSE_SHIELD_v2`.

2. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

3. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

4. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>


   <details><summary><b>In other IDEs</b></summary>

   Follow the instructions in your preferred IDE.
   </details>


   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain is specified in the application's Makefile but you can override this value manually:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

5. After programming, the application starts automatically. Confirm that "Gesture Classification Example" and some log data are printed on the UART terminal. The gesture classifications and confidence are updated continuously.

6. Hold the board with the orientation as shown below while moving your arm to complete a gesture:

   **Figure 1. Board orientation**

   ![](images/board-orientation.jpg)

7. Perform a counter-clockwise circle movement continuously. Confirm that the UART terminal prints the gesture as [**Circle**](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-ml-gesture-classification/blob/master/images/circle.gif), and the confidence of the circle shape increases past 60%. For best results, repeatedly perform circle movements each in one second, with a diameter of one foot.

   **Figure 2. Circle gesture**

   <img src="images/circle.gif" style="zoom: 25%;" />


8. Perform a counter-clockwise square movement continuously. Confirm that the UART terminal prints the gesture as [**Square**](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-ml-gesture-classification/blob/master/images/square.gif), and the confidence of the square shape increases past 60%. For best results, repeatedly perform square shape movements, each in two seconds, with a side length of one foot.

   **Figure 3. Square gesture**

   <img src="images/square.gif" style="zoom:25%;" />

9. Perform a side-to-side movement (left <-> right) continuously. Confirm that the UART terminal prints the gesture as [**Side-to-side**](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-ml-gesture-classification/blob/master/images/side-to-side.gif), and the confidence increases past 60%. For best results, repeatedly perform the one-foot-wide left-to-right movement in half-a-second each.

   **Figure 4. Side-to-side gesture**

   <img src="images/side-to-side.gif" style="zoom:25%;" />

10. When not performing any of these gestures, confirm that the UART terminal prints the gesture as **None**.

> **Note:** If the confidence is lower than 60%, the gesture will register as **None**.

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. 

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

Use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).


> **Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice – once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.infineon.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.

## Design and implementation

In this example, the firmware reads the data from a motion sensor (BMX160) to detect gestures.

The data consists of a 3-axis orientation data from the accelerometer and the gyroscope. A timer is configured to interrupt at 128 Hz. The interrupt handler reads all 6 axes through SPI and signals a task to process the batch of samples when the internal FIFO has 128 new samples. It performs an IIR filter and a min-max normalization on 128 samples at a time. This processed data is then fed to the inference engine. The inference engine outputs the confidence of the gesture for each of the four gesture classes. If the confidence passes a certain percentage, the gesture is printed to the UART terminal.

The code example also provides a ModusToolbox&trade;-ML Configurator tool project file - *design.mtbml*, which points to the pre-trained NN model available in the *pretrained_models* folder.

This application uses FreeRTOS with *gesture task*. The gesture task pre-processes all data and passes the data to the inference engine. FreeRTOS is used so that the code example can be expanded.

**Figure 5. Block diagram**

![](images/block-diagram.png)


### Gesture classification model

The convolutional neural network (CNN) model consists of two convolutional blocks and two full-connection layers. Each convolutional block includes convolutional operations, including rectified linear unit (ReLU) and max pooling, with the addition of a batch normalization layer after the first block.

The convolutional layers act as feature extractors and provide abstract representations of the input sensor data in feature maps. They capture short-term dependencies (spatial relationships) of the data. In CNN, features are extracted and then used as inputs to a fully connected network, using softmax activation for classification.

**Figure 6. Model diagram**

<img src="images/magic-wand-model.png" style="zoom:67%;" />


## Model generation

This code example includes the scripts used to generate the "Magic_wand_model.h5" model. These scripts allow the user to collect data, train a model, and deploy the model to a PSoC&trade; device. These scripts are used as a starting place and show the flow you must go through to produce a model.


### Collect data

The user collects the data to train a model. The gesture classification has code included to print the IMU data out to a terminal. That data is then stored in a text file with the use of a script.

Do the following to collect the data:

1. Open *gesture.h* in the project and change `GESTURE_DATA_COLLECTION_MODE 0u` to `GESTURE_DATA_COLLECTION_MODE 1u`.

2. Remove all files in your project's *train/gesture_data* folder. This is the data used to train the current model.

3. Program the device using the steps from the [Operation](#operation) section. Do not open a terminal window.

4. Open **modus-shell** and navigate to the *train* directory in the current project.

5. Install the requirements with the following command:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
6. Run the following command:

   ```
   ./collect.sh <COM PORT> <GESTURE NAME> <PERSON NAME>

   ```
   The port the device is connected to should be the COM port. The gesture name should be limited to 16 characters. The model is set up for a repeatable gesture such as a circle or square.

7. Perform the named gesture and press **C** to start capturing data. Continuously repeat the gesture until a few minutes of data is collected.

8. Press **S** to stop the data capture.

9. Repeat steps 5 through 7 for each gesture. Scripts support four distinct gestures; one of those gestures should be a "negative" or "no_gesture" classification. All data is stored in TXT files in your project's *train/gesture_data* folder.


### Generate a model

After the data collection, generate a model using that data.

Do the following to generate a model:

1. Open **modus-shell** and navigate to the *train* directory in the current project.

2. Install the requirements with following command if not previously done in the **Collect Data** section:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the following command to run the different scripts that process the data, train the model, and validate the model:

   ```
   ./generate_model.sh
   ```
   The following are generated:

   - Generated model called *User_generated_model.h5/tflite* is stored in *pretrained_models*.

   - Pruned model called *User_generated_model_pruned.h5* is generated with 50 percent pruning and allows for the use of sparsity in the ML Configurator.

   - *gesture_names.h* is generated in your project's *train* folder that stores the names of the user-defined gestures. This is used when printing gesture info out to a terminal.

   - *calibration.npz* file is generated in your project's *train* folder that stores the data used for model calibration or validation.


### Model deployment

Do the following to deploy the generated model to the device.

1. Open the *gesture.h* file and change  `GESTURE_DATA_COLLECTION_MODE 1u` to `GESTURE_DATA_COLLECTION_MODE 0u`.

2. Open **ML Configurator** from the **Quick Panel**.

3. For the **pretrained model** parameter, import the newly generated model from *pretrained_models/User_generated_model.h5/tflite*.

4. If the *User_generated_model_pruned.h5* model is used, select **Enable Sparsity** in ML Configurator.

5. If the selected inference engine is **TFLM** and **Enable quantization** is selected, under **Model Calibration**, set the **Dataset structure** to **NPZ** and the **Path** to *train/calibration.npz*. The *calibration.npz* data can also be used for model validation.

6. Click **Generate Source**.

7. Program the device using the steps from the [Operation](#operation) section.

8. Perform the trained gestures and validate the output in a terminal window.

> **Note:** This code example uses the same flow as described in this section to function. When you run the `./generate_model.sh` command, the code example will not operate as intended. The data used to train the current model is stored in the *gesture_data* file and can be used to train a model.

```

> **Note:** This code example supports CY8CKIT-028-TFT and the CY8CKIT-028-SENSE shields. These shields have different sensors; to support both, a change is made to the *bmi160_defs.h* file. When using CY8CKIT-028-TFT, `BMI160_CHIP_ID` is set to `0xD1`. When using CY8CKIT-028-SENSE, `BMI160_CHIP_ID` is set to `0xD8`. This is done through a series of `PREBUILD` commands in the Makefile.
