## Hardware setup

Connect the CY8CKIT-028-SENSE shield to the Arduino header of your baseboard.

## Software setup

Install a terminal emulator if you don't have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en).

By default, the Makefile uses a model that comes with the code example. The pre-trained Neural Net (NN) model is located in the *pretrained_models* folder. The output files location is set to *mtb_ml_gen*; the project name is set to *magic_wand*. You can use the MTB-ML Configurator Tool to open the *design.mtbml* model to evaluate the model.

## Using the code example

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox</b></summary>

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](http://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. Optionally, change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. Enter the local path in the **Application(s) Root Path** field to indicate where the application needs to be created.

   Applications that can share libraries can be placed in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In command-line interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and a command line tool to easily create one or more ModusToolbox applications. See the "Project Creator Tools" section of the [ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) for more details.

Alternatively, you can manually create the application using the following steps:

1. Download and unzip this repository onto your local machine, or clone the repository.

2. Open a CLI terminal and navigate to the application folder.

   On Windows, use the command line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox installation instead of a standard Windows command line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox tools. You can access it by typing `modus-shell` in the search box in the Windows menu.

   In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

   **Note:** The cloned application contains a default BSP file (*TARGET_xxx.mtb*) in the *deps* folder. Use the [Library Manager](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) (`make modlibs` command) to select and download a different BSP file, if required. If the selected kit does not have the required resources or is not [supported](#supported-kits-make-variable-target), the application may not work.

3. Import the required libraries by executing the `make getlibs` command.

Various CLI tools include a `-h` option that prints help information to the terminal screen about that tool. For more details, see the [ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In Third-party IDEs</b></summary>

1. Follow the instructions from the **In command-line interface (CLI)** section to create the application, and import the libraries using the `make getlibs` command.

2. Export the application to a supported IDE using the `make <ide>` command.

   For a list of supported IDEs and more details, see the "Exporting to IDEs" section of the [ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*.

3. Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal to create or import the application as an IDE project.

</details>

## Operation

If using a PSoC 64 "Secure" MCU kit (like CY8CKIT-064B0S2-4343W), the PSoC 64 device must be provisioned with keys and policies before being programmed. Follow the instructions in the ["Secure Boot" SDK user guide](https://www.cypress.com/documentation/software-and-drivers/psoc-64-secure-mcu-secure-boot-sdk-user-guide) to provision the device. If the kit is already provisioned, copy-paste the keys and policy folder to the application folder.

1. Connect the CY8CKIT-028-SENSE shield to the baseboard kit.

2. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

3. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

4. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>

   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. You can specify a target and toolchain manually:
      ```
      make program TARGET=<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TARGET=CY8CPROTO-062-4343W TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
      </details>

5. After programming, the application starts automatically. Confirm that "Gesture Classification Example" and some log data are printed on the UART terminal, the gesture classifications and confidence are updated continuously.

6. Hold the board with the following orientation while moving your arm to complete a gesture:

   **Figure 1. Board orientation**

   ![](images/board-orientation.jpg)

7. Perform a counter-clockwise circle movement continuously and confirm that the UART terminal prints the gesture as **Circle** and the confidence of the circle increases past 70%.

8. Perform a counter-clockwise square movement continuously and confirm that the UART terminal prints the gesture as **Square** and the confidence of the square increases past 70%.

9. Perform a side-to-side movement (left <-> right) continuously and confirm that the UART terminal prints the gesture as **Side-to-side** and the confidence side-to-side increases past 70%.

10. When not performing any of the gestures above, confirm that the UART terminal prints the gesture as **None**.

    **Note**: If the confidence is lower than 70% then the gesture will register as **None**.

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For more details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

**Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice - once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.cypress.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.

## Design and implementation

In this example, the firmware reads the data from a motion sensor (BMX160) to detect gestures. The data consists of 3-axis orientation data from the accelerometer and 3-axis orientation data from the gyroscope. A timer is configured to interrupt at 128 Hz. The interrupt handler reads all 6 axes through SPI and signals a task to process the batch of samples when the internal FIFO has 128-sample new samples. It performs an IIR filter and a min-max normalization on 128 samples at a time. This processed data is then fed to the inference engine. The inference engine outputs the confidence of the gesture for each of the four gesture classes. If the confidence passes a certain percent, the gesture is printed to the UART terminal.

The code example also provides a MTB-ML Configurator tool project file - *design.mtbml*, which points to the pre-trained NN model available in the *pretrained_models* folder.

This application uses FreeRTOS. There are three tasks in the system - *sensor task*, *NN task* and *control task*. They communicate with each other through queues. Sensor data is fed to the input queue, and the result is sent to the output queue.

   **Figure 2. Block diagram**

### Gesture classification model details

The convolutional neural network (CNN) model consists of two convolutional blocks and two full connection layers. Each convolutional block includes convolutional operations, including relu and max pooling, with the addition of a batch normalization layer after the first block. The convolutional layers act as feature extractors and provide abstract representations of the input sensor data in feature maps. They capture short-term dependencies (spatial relationships) of the data. In the CNN, features are extracted and then used as inputs of fully connected network, using softmax activation for classification.
